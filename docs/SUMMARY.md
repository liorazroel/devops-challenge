First, I created the Flask application along with its routers using Python.
I installed the required libraries locally so I could work in the PyCharm IDE.
Once I verified that the code was working correctly, I created the .env file and Dockerfile. 
After confirming that the Dockerfile was functioning as expected, I proceeded to create the docker-compose.yml file.
